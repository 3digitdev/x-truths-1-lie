# x-truths-1-lie
Play "3 Truths and a Lie" with friends online

## TODO:

- Validate inputs
- Clear validation errors on actions
- Make players' names unique only within each game (not globally)
- Comment code
- Cleanup code (reorg, remove unused, etc)
- Hide "host-only" buttons (like "Start Game") for all but the game's host
